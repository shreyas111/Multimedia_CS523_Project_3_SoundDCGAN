# Sound Generation Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
In this project we have tried to generate sound from  three sound .wav files in three different approaches. Each approach is implemented in a separate interactive python file (ipynb) file.

## Approach 1: Piano_Music_Same.ipynb 

## Approach 2: drum_beats.ipynb

## Approach 3: StringBeats.ipynb
