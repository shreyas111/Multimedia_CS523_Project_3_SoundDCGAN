# Sound Generation Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
In this project we have tried to generate sound from DCGAN using 3 different approaches. Each approach is implemented in a separate interactive python file (ipynb) file. 

## Running the Project

1. Run Each .ipynb file to see the outputs we obtained for each approach. All instructions are present in the .ipynb files.
2. Apporach 1 for generating music from Sound DCGAN is explained in Piano_Music_Same.ipynb
3. Approach 2 for generating music from Sound DCGAN is explained in drum_beats.ipynb
4. Approach 3 for generating music from Sound DCGAN is explained in StringBeats.ipynb

## Approach 1: Piano_Music_Same.ipynb 

## Approach 2: drum_beats.ipynb

## Approach 3: StringBeats.ipynb
